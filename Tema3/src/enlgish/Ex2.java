		 * Write a program that allows the user to store an arithmetic sequence at an
		 * array and then the program will show it on the screen. An arithmetic sequence
		 * is a series of numbers that starts by an initial value V, and then it
		 * continues with increases of a value I. For example, with V=1 and I=2 the
		 * sequence would be: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9â€¦ With V=7 and I=10, the sequence would be:
		 * 7, 17, 27, 37 The program will ask the user the values V and I, furthermore
		 * the number of values to create (the length of the array).
